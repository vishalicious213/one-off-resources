            - Sales engineering teaches marketing, negotiating, international finance
                - Good at math but more social people
                - They can answer technical questions like an engineer but can sell to clients
                - It's harder to convert sales person into technical than the other way around

            - Software wasn't complicated, was getting data from satellites (NASA API download), doing data manipulation and displaying it
            - One update per yet with very few features, he thought it was a scam, was costing his company $1M/year
                - Girlfriend was in Brazil and knew Python

                - Made an MVP, downloaded data, displayed it on computer (was terrible code but worked)
                - Told boss that he could build it, told his boss that if he hired engineers he could rebuild it

                    - People were all using Excel and emails and everything was manual
                    - He prefered to use time to automate
                    - Wrote small scripts for his whole career and was more productive than his coworkers
                    - Knew he could be a director by 30
                - American company bought them, he was one of the few French people who stayed (out of 10)

                    - He had to force his sales guy to sell door-to-door (fertilizer to farmers)
                    - Title was great, but his life was miserable
                    - Civil engineering was much better than selling fertilizer
                - Left to form a company with his uncle, business failed
- Was unemployed, no company and no title, money was running dry
    - Wife pointed out that he liked coding in all of his previous jobs
    - Wife told him to go into it and give it a try
    - He found out about 100Devs in Aug 2022
        - Caught up with 2nd cohort, and it changed his life, went all in (full-time)
        - Was going it 10 hours a day, aimed to be ready for the hunt in September
            - Was watching vids at 2X speed
            - Skipped recaps b/c last video was 2 hours ago
- 100Devs
    - Don't skip the homework
    - He did skip the floats one ;)
    - Was advised to deactivate his old LinkedIn and create a new one for software engineering
        - Old one had all of his contacts from previous industry
        - He was at class 35 and knew the hunt was coming
            - Knew there was a 50 connection per week limit
            - Made new profile, no one from previous life, only 100Devs members, started early
        - At class 50, he wasn't ready for the hunt and was receiving messages from recruiters every day
            - Hadn't done Banki or 100Hours project
            - Started to do interviews with the idea of failing interviews that he didn't want
                - Used it for learning
                - Interviewing skills aren't innate, you have to train
                - Fail interviews with companies you don't care about, not with ones that you want to work at
            - Did 20 interviews, some failed b/c he wasn't prepared for the tests
                - Failed some technical assessments
                - Got 3 offers (one for company where he works now)
- LinkedIn:
    - Knew how LinkedIn works, more than 60% of revenue is from recruiters
        - They have to provide search engine for recruiters
        - Main purpose is to suggest you to recruiters
        - Same as SEO at Google, you can guess/reverse engineer some things
            - Connections (first things you see are profile pic, title and connections)
                - Plus if you're a friend of a friend
                - Recruiter will see a friend of a friend as a candidate and friend will help convert
    - Try to add people in your region who are in tech, no one outside of tech
        - Not too many people from 100Devs b/c you're competing for the same recruiters
        - Try to add recruiters from people who are close to you
             - 70% of his offers were from recruiters in Portugal
        - If you're in a small town, go to network events, add people, every recruiter they know will pop up in your connections and you'll show up in theirs
    - Leon tested with fresh account
        - Pick an area, send connection requests even w/o messages
        - There's a bot that can search people and help find/add them
        - LinkedIn shows you who's connected to who, add the right people and you come up in those circles
    - Add people in tech and recruiters, other people will make decisions harder for program
        - There are tutorials for recruiters to use LinkedIn search
            - There are filters for connections, keywords, job descriptions, skills
    - Look for all of the job offers on LinkedIn, look for opportunities to add missing skills in the offers
        - Get 100Devs people to endorse you for those skills
        - Learn those skills on the weekend
- Hot takes:
    - Don't put previous experience, put freelance and 100Devs
    - Previous experience will tell search engine that you're not someone who did coding for their whole life
    - Don't let the search engine block you because of this
    - Prepare and craft your story
        - Exaggerate on your years of experience, but don't go crazy with it
            - If you did 6 months, call it 1 year
            - If you did 1 year, call it 1.5 or 2 years
            - There's a big filter on experience (you need 2 years of experience)
                - Some recruiters look at every month, just to tick boxes
            - He sees people with 6-8 years of experience and 100Devs people are BETTER than some of them
    - When he was hiring people, he would say that the company was amazing
    - Open to Work: Don't Use It
        - It makes it look like you're desparate for work
    - Certifications: Except for cloud/security training, nothing else matters, don't put them
        - Only bootcampers would put this on their LinkedIn
        - Security cert is like $1000
    - Don't put lame projects on your profile
- You have to create a new profile, the internet remembers your history, even if you delete it
    - Go to events, add everyone, do freelancing
- When exaggerating XP, you'll be nervous for the first month but you'll realize that you're good for the company
    - After 2 weeks, he realized that he was producing more than his colleagues
    - Git is much harder at work than when you work alone, do group projects
    - His coding salary is better than when he was a director
        - He makes $50k in Portugal, which is 5X more than the average salary there
- Study, help people, be good to people
- Did two 100Devs lessons a day, all of the homework and 1 codewars
