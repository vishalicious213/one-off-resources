## Notes

- Think about how you would go about hiring a plumber or another service person when you're job hunting
    - Who goes to the top of your list?
        - The person with the referral from someone you know
        - The person who responded quickly, had a body of work
        - These are the people submitting proposals & getting reviews & referrals
    - People at the bottom of the list are the ones with no proof (reviews, referrals)
        - Even if they give you 10% off, if they have no proof, they don't get hired
        - Errors cost money
        - This is the person who just clicked apply
    - Straine — Not even going to take them if they do the "I'll do it for half the price of that other guy" right?  Keep that in mind if you feel like you should undersell yourself for that first job

### Hitlisting

- Only 30% of jobs get posted to job boards
    - Maybe 10-50% are a good fit
    - Most will be on platforms where they get innundated with spam, you can't stand out
    - You're fist-fighting for 10% of jobs in a mosh pit
- You can 60 networked recommended applications
    - Can be an implicit referral (you ask who the best person to talk to is & they connect you to that person)
    - m.Campos — It's really more about the process to get to the 60 referrals. The number is daunting but what you do to get there is what will get you the job
    - Most people aren't successful in the first few applications, you have to learn what needs to be tweaked & changed
- Find a hiring manager, an engineer on the team, a recruiter
    - Add to hitlist
    - Follow on Twitter
    - Find their email
    - Ask for coffee chat
    - Send a thank you
    - Get the recommendation
- Recruiters are paid to talk to you, you can spend less energy on messages to them
    - Focus message energy on hiring managers & engineers
    - You can be more direct with the recruiter
    - Be more friendly with the hiring manager & engineer
- A lot of companies use 3rd party applications to manage their job postings
    - Even when they post on their websites, they use these applications (like Workday)
- Companies that were hiring in the past year are probably going to keep hiring

)
    - ("javascript" AND ("boston" OR “Boston, MA”)) (engineer OR developer) -senior -sr -sr. -"staff engineer" -lead -principal after:2025-08-01
- Use this to get jobs before other people even see them
- m.Campos — You can edit it and add more sites that toe to your specific background
- dvkr — ^^ you'll want to change Boston to where you live
- Can change it to "remote" or "global" or "distributed" for more opportunities
- Find a company, look them up on LinkedIn, filter for people, look for people you're connected to, add to hitlist (hiring managers, engineering managers, recruiters)
    - If they have messages open on LinkedIn, reach out to them there
- lilpancake — What I do is go to the search option and just hit "search" without typing anything in. When you click on Jobs, there's an option to select "In my network" to see who in your network is hiring

## Chat



## Slido

- lol leon my question is too long for the slido input, but it has to do with best practices for the "hit list." Please let me speak (she asked about how much time to invest in relationships with different people at companies)
    - Some people don't care about building relationships, its a huge numbers game for them
    - Some people take a hybrid approach, they hit recruiters, tell them why they're a good fit & ask for the job
        - They take a slower approach with hiring managers
    - Only way to know what works for you is to try each for a week & see which is best
    - Straine — If you're a smooth mofo, tailored works.  If not?  Numbers.  You can test it both ways and see which gets you more results, you have 180 people to test on
    - dvkr — I tell them I saw the JD in like the first two minutes of the chat but they can tell it's genuine interest in the company/product

- I didn't click apply and heard back about a Junior Java role! I've only done LeetCode problems in Java. How do I present my resume and sell myself effectively?
    - You have to show them they you have what they need to see to quell their reservations about hiring you
    - Get rid of their fears by going through 100Devs, having a body of work, good LinkedIn, resume, etc.

- Can you get by without using AI. It ruins the fun in coding for me but I know companies want you to use it for "efficiency" thoughts?
    - Yes, a lot of people use it like autocomplete, not as a full-blown editor
    - Some companies do want to see how AI-native you are, so you pick your poison

- If we find someone on Apollo or Hunter.io - is it appropriate to send a cold email or should we always use linkedin?
    - You can always email a recruiter, its their job to talk to you
    - You're reaching out professionally, not their personal email or phone, don't be afraid
    - suicyco (Micah) — they want nothing more than to get that hiring done, you are helping them by ending that process - be the solution to their big problem (hiring someone)
