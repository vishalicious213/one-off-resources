## Notes

- Relentlessly show up & don't give up
- Reddit is a cesspool of people who aren't doing the work, stay off of it
- Look at labor data, not people who don't look at job reports
    - Software engineer unemployment is 3% lower than national average

### Sean Basquiat

- ShawnBasquiat, whose portfolio we watch, just landed a job offer after getting laid off 3 months ago, he popped up onstage to let us know that its happening
    - It might be at Workday
    - Know who you're taking feedback from, talk to hiring managers, don't talk to people in the middle of what you're doing b/c the feedback will make you question things
        - Straine ‚Äî Sounds like the old "Don't take criticism from a person you wouldn't take advice from" adage.  Be careful what advice  you take to heart, it's always just one view and maybe just a 20 second lookover
        - emme ‚Äî Shawn is saying to know who you‚Äôre getting feedback from bc sometimes the feedback is too generic. You don‚Äôt want to randomly change your resume
    - Don't take advice from people who haven't hired anyone or have only gotten one job or have been stuck at the same place for 5+ years
        - Everyone on the interview stage has their own interests
            - Recruiter wants you hired
            - Hiring manager wants you to be a good fit
        - Know who has the final say, how can you optimize for that
    - Lexi (needs to relax) ‚Äî Ah yes, the noise vs signal issue

### LinkedIn

- Everyone will look at your LinkedIn, some people will look at your resume
    - Check your privacy settings, make sure that everyone can message you
        - Turn on discoverability & the ability for people to message you
- People looking for you who don't have your profile / don't know your name will look at companies you worked at, titles, experience, location
    - What can they see & what will they type in to search & find you
    - anjomi ‚Äî it looks like most of what he said is available under the visibility tab in settings, but mainly things that make sure people can find you
    - Straine ‚Äî My self-search yesterday turned up my linkedin and my portfolio before anything else, even though I have professional publications.  Let it simmer for a while so you show up.
    - lava (UX + Freelance) ‚Äî fyi this works bc i got my current job through a linkedin recruiter and he said it was bc i had keywords in my profile!
- Keywords in resume can help recruiters find you, too
    - Make sure you upload it & that permissions are on so it can be used in searches
- Your activity matters, responding to messages matters b/c LinkedIn is trying to be a social network
    - It liked you warming up your profile every day for 15 mins
    - LinkedIn surfaces you in the feed more if you're engaging, scrolling, liking, commenting before you post
        - Posts will get more visibility if you do the above first
        - You want to do all of this to get inbound interest
    - Lexi (needs to relax) ‚Äî I've heard people complain about LinkedIn being "the new facebook" but this is the game
- Join groups on LI in your area
- Go live & join people going live in your area
    - "Hey, it was great connecting with you in so & so's stream today, I wanted to reach out & connect"
    - Reach out to professionals & recruiters going live, not people job-hunting
- If connection requests go unanswered, wait a month, delete them & send again
    - Don't send messages, send messages after they accept you
    - If people have open groups you can join, message people in that group to connect with the person you're after & message the person you're hunting in the list
    - Dthompsondev ~Mayanwolfe can DM~ ‚Äî This is how I find execs to network with for events
- Don't worry about being cringe vs being seen, the thing you're afraid of is what's holding you back
- Davie (lurking) ‚Äî It‚Äôs hard to come up with posts. I have no idea where to start
    - Dthompsondev ~Mayanwolfe can DM~ ‚Äî "It‚Äôs hard to come up with posts. I have no idea where to start."
        - This feeling used to stop me all the time. I was waiting for a "big idea" to strike.
        - The biggest mindset shift for me was this: Document, don't create.
        - Instead of "What's an insightful post?"
        - Try: "What was the main takeaway from my last meeting?"
        - Instead of "How can I sound like a thought leader?"
        - Try: "What's a problem I just solved, and what were the steps?"
        - Instead of "What will get a lot of likes?"
        - Try: "What's a simple piece of advice I gave a colleague today?"
        - Your daily work, your challenges, and your small wins are the content.
        - Someone out there is one step behind you, and they need to hear exactly what you're learning right now.
        - There is your linkedin post bro 

### Profiles

- The top of your profile is your prime real estate, billboard, banner
    - This is what people will see & use to decide if they want to take the extra sec to read
    - In those few seconds, they need to know who you are: a developer, professional, speaker, they need to see social proof
        - Present yourself with authority by listing what you are
        - Danny's profile shows pics of him with groups of people at tech forums
        - If you don't have pics like that, show pics of the tech that you work with
- Your title is the most important piece of your profile
    - Shows up in searches
    - Have to show what your looking for
    - Show title, skills, fun
        - Software engineer | Skills | Interests
- Put your contact into in your contact section
- Your About is the 2nd most important bit
    - You can use the story that we craft & use it on LinkedIn
    - No one will click "See More"
    - The above-the-fold pieces are essentially invisible
    - Impactful statements should be the first line or two
- Featured section is the next most important section
    - Put things in here that show you're a professional & are actively working in the space
    - Can be projects, talks, meetups, should be professional & good, its your calling card
        - Don't out your tic-tac-toe game here
- Your Activity is next
    - Don't be hostile towards people b/c it shows up here & everyone can see it
    - People will look here to see if you're doing anything weird
    - Don't yell at people online, don't share your opinions on LI, save it for Twitter
    - Show that you're a good team member & a positive member of society
    - Don't be overly argumentative or have too many hot takes
    - Straine ‚Äî Save it for a Twitter that's not linked to your professional accounts, too.  Don't want them clicking your Twitter link and boom, there's the negativity
    - ichtragebrille (Amanda) ‚Äî a guy was rude on my blolg post and I took it as an opportunity to be kind and constructive bc it makes me look good HO HO
    - Dthompsondev ~Mayanwolfe can DM~ ‚Äî Remember, recruiters are literally PAID to be on linkedin finding people. Make it easier for them to want to talk to you. Want to cuss some folks out, make a throwaway account
- Finally, your Experience
    - Show titles & 1-2 big bullet points for each position
    - Add skills specific to the role
    - Include pieces that reinforce what you did at the role
    - Skills show up in searches

### Open To Work

- Controversial, recruiters can see you more easily but it can affect inbound interest
- People who see Open to Work generally pick up a smell, they think you're messaging them b/c you want a job
- Turn it on & turn it off, you show up in the Open To Work results/category for a week
- Lisa (lurk) ‚Äî i saw recruiters say that they have a bias against those who put open for work. ü´§

### Jake

- Photo is really good, clean, professional, smiling, looks approachable
- Don't use AI for your photo
- Local libraries have free headshot nights
    - The_limit404 ‚Äî Use natural light. Overcast is great for headshots. Ring light catchlights are creepy. (I used to take pro headshots and many years later people are still using them on LinkedIn)
- His About is too small, he needs to have more about crafting his story in it
- His Featured needs to have more that he's done that keep interest
- His Activity is good, shows he's engagine & helping folk
- His Experience should show more impact
    - Skills there should show actual skills, names of programming languages, not generics
    - Make logos & pics for Experiences
- Jake_Haver_of_Catz (Class 20) ‚Äî https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakehaverofcatz/?trk=opento_sprofile_topcard

## Chat

- Steven ‚Äî one thing i heard recently is it's important to reply to every single message you get on linkedin because recruiters may filter you out if you're "not likely to respond"
- Rai Bread üçû (HUNT, C51) ‚Äî when recruiters search keywords they can see them from ur resume too
- Lexi (needs to relax) ‚Äî The posts that people find cringe are usually people treating LinkedIn as a dating site or crass politics
- Dthompsondev ~Mayanwolfe can DM~ ‚Äî I swear I have heard variations of this in the past (never Cringe) BUT I have heard that I talk too much, say the same stuff, etc. To which I said "It's good to know you are a loyal reader üòé "
- Dthompsondev ~Mayanwolfe can DM~ ‚Äî My headline could be better but truthfully, visibility is not something that I PERSONALLY need help with luckily. I care more about conversational hooks because they are already looking at my stuff
- Dthompsondev ~Mayanwolfe can DM~ ‚Äî If you see the "see more" button, you are hiding all the value
- Roxy RodBeck ‚Äî i updated my featured posts so that the first couple sentences explains what it's about
- Lisa (lurk) ‚Äî i think screenshots of your work helps a lot
- Cindy ‚Äî can someone judge my linkedIn profile thank you!
    - https://www.linkedin.com/in/cindy-ngoho/
    - Dthompsondev ~Mayanwolfe can DM~ ‚Äî Needs work. "Built 5 Al apps and APIs using NextJS, OpenAI, Pinecone, StripeAPI within a given deadline" Why?
        - "Developed projects from design to deployment using MVC design patterns with a team of 4 engineering fellows from diverse nationalities" Why? What did it do?
