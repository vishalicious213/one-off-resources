# Updating LinkedIn: ChatGPT Plan based on notes from RaSK and Leon Noel's sessions at 100Devs:

Based on the notes from your meetings with RaSK and Leon Noel, here's an actionable plan to optimize your LinkedIn profile and enhance your visibility to tech recruiters:

### 1. **Profile Basics**
   - **Profile Photo**: Use a professional, business-casual headshot against a neutral background. Keep it simple and approachable (gentle smile). Ensure your photo settings are visible to "anyone" so you appear in more searches.
   - **Background Image**: Utilize this space to highlight your skills or recent projects. Tools like Canva (free) have templates specifically for LinkedIn banners.
   - **Title (Headline)**: Craft an SEO-friendly headline. Include specific keywords related to your expertise (e.g., “Software Engineer | Web Developer | Helping Businesses Optimize with Modern Technologies”). You can use tools like the LinkedIn headline generator from Copy.ai to get ideas.
   - **Location**: Set your location to areas where you want to find work, especially if you're open to relocation or working remotely. Recruiters often filter by location.

### 2. **Content & Keywords**
   - **About Section**: This is your story. Write a compelling narrative about your journey into tech, your skills, and what you’re passionate about. Use strong keywords throughout (e.g., "JavaScript," "React," "Node.js") that are relevant to your target job roles. Remember, the first 250 characters are crucial as they show before "See More."
   - **Experience Section**: For each job, describe your role in detail and focus on the skills and accomplishments related to software development. Add links, images, or media for projects you’ve worked on, especially your portfolio and freelance work. Use the 2000 characters per entry wisely, and include keywords relevant to the job market.
   - **Skills**: Ensure that your technical skills (e.g., JavaScript, Python, React) are up to date. Focus on skills listed in job descriptions that interest you. Ask for endorsements from 100Devs members and others in your network.
   - **Projects/Featured Section**: Turn on Creator Mode and showcase your most significant projects (e.g., 100Hours project, Banki project) to demonstrate your technical abilities.

### 3. **Connections & Network Building**
   - **Quality of Connections**: Focus on adding tech recruiters, people in your target industry, and professionals in your region. Avoid adding too many people from 100Devs to avoid competition for the same recruiters.
   - **Connection Strategy**: Send 50 connection requests per week, especially to people local to the areas you are hunting for jobs. Even if you don’t send a message, it will increase your network's visibility. If requests go unanswered, unsend and resend them.
   - **Recruiter Connections**: Search for and connect with recruiters in your desired job locations. Being connected to local recruiters increases your chances of appearing in relevant searches.
   
### 4. **Activity & Engagement**
   - **Be Active**: Log in at least once a week and engage with posts (like, comment, and share). Being active increases your visibility in LinkedIn searches. Even if you're not ready to post regularly, engaging with others’ content will help.
   - **Content Creation**: Aim to post regularly (weekly if possible). Share insights about coding, articles, or collaborative projects (e.g., software engineering practices). This increases engagement and exposure.
   - **Open to Work**: Set the "Open to Work" status, but only make it visible to recruiters, not publicly. After a week or so, turn it off while still appearing in searches.
   
### 5. **Story Crafting & Profile Optimization**
   - **Career Progression**: Showcase a clear career transition in your About and Experience sections. Mention your previous roles but frame them as part of your progression toward software engineering (e.g., automating tasks with Python in a previous sales job).
   - **Exaggerate Experience (Within Reason)**: If you’ve been coding for 6 months, consider labeling it as 1 year. Recruiters often have filters for experience thresholds, so this helps bypass automated systems.
   - **Don’t Include Non-Tech Jobs**: Avoid listing non-tech jobs unless they directly relate to problem-solving, project management, or technology. Focus on coding-related experience to avoid the “new developer smell.”
   
### 6. **Other Recommendations**
   - **Endorsements Bash**: Participate in 100Devs endorsement bashes to get skill endorsements and recommendations.
   - **Groups**: Join relevant LinkedIn groups in your local area and tech-specific groups to increase your visibility in recruiter searches. This also helps build relationships within the local tech community.
   
By following these steps, you'll improve your LinkedIn presence, optimize it for recruiter searches, and actively build a network to support your job hunt.
