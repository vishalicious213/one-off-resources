## Notes

- Favorite classes were math and concert band, grew up with someone who wasn't an English speaker so had a harder time with reading
- In high school, dream was to be a developer
    - Back then no one needed developers
    - Was looking for tech-related jobs in 2001-2002
    - Gave up on college and a career b/c she wanted to be in tech and couldn't find anything
    - Fell into depression for 5-6 years, partying, screwing up and doing everything you don't want to be doing
        - Doesn't share on LinkedIn or anywhere else
    - Changed after getting pregnant and seeing that she had to take care of someone
- Went to a local community college, wasn't a lot of selection, chose web application development, got certification and associates degree
    - Opportunities started a year after classes
    - Wanted to be a decent human being and be able to care for her child and/or children
    - Grew up around tech, dad was a network engineer and hobby programmer
    - To this day, that's all he talks about, now it's mainly cybersecurity, she loves her dad
        - Now that he's older, the stories repeat
- It was fulfilling to feel like she was doing something with her life that had meaning instead of being lost and having random jobs and being a loser because she had no guidance
    - Her dad said that you are who you surround yourself with
    - She surrounded herself with people who weren't great and finally removed them and got a new phone
        - She was tired of being broke and having no money in the bank
- Degree required 6 months of 2 different internships to complete the degree
    - Panicked because she didn't know how to find internships
    - 1 year into classes, during a Visual Basic class, she started talking to a random girl in class
    - She's an introvert who can be extroverted in the right environment
    - Asked girl why she joined the class
    - Girl ran a web dev agency and wanted to brush up on her tech skills b/c she was more in management
        - She said that she's looking for an internship soon
        - Girl said that she was looking for an intern and ended up bringing her on for 3 months for frontend and to work on client websites
            - Reviewed her code, offered suggestions, was very nice
    - 2nd one happened b/c the same teacher taught most of the classes, she'd show up early and stay an hour later b/c she loved building and started helping everyone else with their projects
        - She did this to help keep projects fresh in her mind
        - Teacher saw this happening and offered her a TA position, which became an internship
    - These opportunities had a domino effect into the next thing
- Graduated, but so much more happened before then
    - Was asked if she'll really be prepared for software engineer role interviews after graduation
    - Was told to practice interviewing but had no resources to do so
    - Started applying to a lot of jobs, hundreds of entry level software engineering jobs after 1 year of schooling
    - Did side projects for friends for fun, weekend projects that ramped up her resume, she used these b/c she had no real job experience
    - Most of her interviews were them laughing at her and asking her why she's even trying
        - People told her she wasn't even ready and shouldn't be applying there, she would ask why they were interviewing her then b/c they saw her resume
        - She looked for and loved good feedback that helped her improve, used this to get better for the next interview
        - Eventually she was so confident and comfortable that she went all the way to the final round
            - Instead of asking to build something in a short period of time, was asked to review code and explain what it was doing
            - Talked about the code, about ways she would improve it and got an offer
            - Was afraid b/c she'd have to go to college and work full-time
            - Offered $40k and she negotiated to $50k, was accepted
            - She hadn't applied to that specific company, Craigslist was really popular back then, wrote up a cover letter and posted it publicly there, hiring manager from one of the biggest snowboarding and ski companies reached out to interview her
                - She didn't know what she was showing up to, address seemed legit, showed up at a huge office in Seattle
                    - Loved jobs, company meetings were in the mountains, was building internal tools for the snowboard team, kept getting free products, gifts every day on her desk
                    - She was still in school, was showing up to work 2 hours early (5-6 AM) every day and worked on homework before she started work, it was nonstop
                    - She never felt like she could breathe or take a break, it was nonstop, it was rough and she had depression issues during those years that she eventually overcame
            - At that point, she had 2 babies and had a relationship that was falling apart, was trying to take care of the babies on the weekend
                - Ended up leaving that relationship, had to walk away from everything, didn't have the money to go to court
                - Cried in the office every day, had great co-workers who supported her
                - They helped her get her head back together, they were like her therapy group
- She had to go to a lot of conterences, take notes, learn a ton, it was really rough
    - Someone at a conference told her that they were looking for open-source contributors
    - She didn't know what that was, he was going around asking everyone
    - She reached out and joined a project, that was in 2013 and they became her family, she was very alone, it became her life
        - She spent 20 hours a week and every weekend being part of that project
        - Started with bug testing, then extension directory team, then leadership team and was there for a long time, production decision team
        - Was emotionally and mentally invested in every way, it became her love
        - Did that for many years
        - That journey led her to her role now
- She got to the point where she was doing too much, 90 mins driving to the office, got a side job as a support engineer and was helping on a forum at nights
    - Got tired of the drive and being so busy
    - Was also working part-time at the college teaching programming courses
        - This happened b/c the teacher had an emergency hospital situation, teacher remembered her as an intern and doing well in class
        - She had the school ask if she could teach one class and was offered a part-time job after the first class
        - She was a part-time workaholic which might have helped overcome depression, it gave her meaning in life
- She ended up leaving the developer job
    - They called her in after she gave her 2 weeks and offered to double her salary
    - She didn't want to do the drive, she would fall asleep during the drive and was risking her life
    - Moving closer wasn't an option, downtown Seattle was too expensive
    - They promised to hire more people but never did, she was just handed more work
    - 1-2 weeks before she left, the college also called and told her they need a full-time instructor
- She wanted to start a company but didn't have a plan
    - Went into complete panic after 2 weeks, it was so hard to make things happen
    - She took the full-time instructor position, got the offer b/c she put in the effort over so much time and had doors open for her
- Everyone's journey is different, for her staying after class and helping people started the domino effect for her but it might not have the same effect for everyone
    - Leon did the same thing, helping people at General Assembly and they offered him the chance to teach the course, which led to Resilient Coders
    - During these years, she was still going to conferences
    - An open source project she was contributing to started sending her to conferences with all expenses paid
        - This led to her going on podcasts and getting her next opportunity
        - One person she was with at a conference was a developer advocate, she didn't know what that was
            - She learned that they speak, educate, do teaching, listen to developers, take feedback
            - She learned that developer advocates get paid really well compared to teacher salaries
                - She was also working for an agency doing database migration work
                - She was very low-paid as a teacher
            - Researched developer advocates, there wasn't much info and only one book
                - Reached out to senior developer advocates on Twitter
                    - Only one person reached back out, a senior advocate at Google
                    - Asked for 30 mins of time to learn about his journey
                    - Turned into an hour, learned she needed a portfolio, be loud in public, write, get her voice heard
                    - Applied to 100 developer advocate roles, tracked it on a spreadsheet
                        - Got a lot of No's, one person made her cry (won't name the company or person, was another woman)
                        - She knew she had to step away from that and knew she was worthy of being a developer advocate
                        - Was told that she was years from becoming one and didn't have what it takes
                        - Realized that it wasn't that company that was right for her but was looking for one (applied twice to Cisco)
                    - Was talking to someone about applying to Cisco, which was her top company, and that person knew the hiring manager for that team, put in a word for her and they immediately called her
                        - This was after she applied twice, only saw her last application, they didn't even know
                        - Was 6 rounds of interviews, took forever, really big team that she had to meet, hit it off with everyone
                            - Technical test
                            - Video presentation on how to use their API, had 24 hours to submit, struggled with it for 5-6 hours and had to walk away and restart, was panicking b/c she wanted to get it done as fast as she could
                            - Got hired, spent 3 years there, started at $80k, got raises and went to $120k
                            - When she's at a company, she dedicated herself, puts in her best effort and goes all-in
- Whenever she talked to someone, she didn't go straight to what her intentions were
    - Genuinely loved people, loved talking to them
    - Her entire LinkedIn is all job-hunters using AI-generated text and she doesn't respond to them
        - Told someone that they should work on having genuine conversations and not use AI
            - They responded with an AI-generated message
            - This was yesterday, they responded and said that she's right and they're going to stop doing that and work on doing it themselves
- How did she work through the negativity and bad feedback early in her career
    - She shared how she would cry and get emotional in the past
    - She's learned to be confident, she looks in the mirror and tells herself that she can do things, that she's awesome
    - It's the voice in her head that takes over and makes her spiral, she had to learn to take control of it
        - She wasn't able to do it until she was, it wasn't easy to learn
    - Does mini-meditations, a minute long, sometimes 5 mins
        - Breathe in, breathe out, hold it, refresh her mind and begin the moment again
    - Constantly putting herself in a good mindset helped her
    - Social anxiety was very strong in her childhood was what led to her being on computers
        - Took a long time to start getting over it, had to find tools to help her at conferences
        - Affected her building relationships and networking, worried that people hated her and were telling people not to talk to her
    - She never provided advice but can talk about what worked for her
        - Got to the point, 5 years ago, where she was ok with people disliking her and talking negatively about her
        - Realized that she's doing important things and didn't need to dwell on those people
        - Realized that it was their problem
        - She never had friends in high school, especially with boys who would pick on quiet people
- She has a big title but doesn't like to feel better anyone
    - She's just a human who's going through life like everyone else
- After 3 years at Cisco (seems to be the magical number) someone reached out to her who she had met at a conference
    - That person kept introducing her to people, this guy liked doing that
    - Knew someone who was looking to hire a senior-level developer advocate and didn't have many options, asked her to jump on a call with him
    - Ended up being a really exciting opportunity, she thought it was a startup b/c there were only 200 people there
    - Money was REALLY good, life-changing, bought a Porsche, learned not to waste money on depreciating assets
    - Learned that she was ready to move into a more leadership role
        - You don't just apply and get head of team roles, there's a lot of training involved to get to that place
        - Working really hard and extra hours doesn't get you there
        - Working with her mentor, she met with an executive coach
        - She's 5-years into her contract with him, she renews every year
        - Had her study the description of a person with that role to really understand it
        - Talked with her boss and told him it's what she wants to do, whether she gets the job or not
        - Started focusing on metrics and speaking about using them to make changes
        - Eventually got promoted, which caught her off guard
- Internet crashed again came back and she was working with Appwrite

## After 3rd crash

- Take time to make your resume stand out
    - For example, don't send template applications, join their community, engage their community, make friends with people there, have conversations and then reach out
    - Not every product has a community, but put in the effort to join if they do, it puts you ahead of everyone else
    - Have a clear and concise resume that shows the value you provide at each position
    - Person she hired was a 100Devs grad, she didn't know about the program then
- Can take a long time scanning resumes looking for information
    - Wants to go straight to the important information
- Some jobs require a cover letter, AppWrite has a "why do you want to work for us" question, this is her opportunity to learn about the applicant
- In today's market, you have to do a lot more, some people get lucky
    - Use genuine words, don't use AI, use spellcheck
    - Use your own personality to write, you can use AI, but rewrite it in your own words
- If you're applying to a product company, make sure you have their product on your resume and you can use it
- If you're struggling looking for an opportunity, keep trying, sometimes it takes months or years b/c of life
    - Take care of yourself mentally
    - It only takes one opportunity and your life changes from then on

## Slido questions

- What does she look for in an applciant
    - How well they write, do they use the app, how do they communicate
    - She gets applications for people looking for work, but gets so many of them that she has to ignore b/c she doesn't have enough time to help everyone

    - Putting out hundreds of resumes worked in the past but doesn't work as much anymore
- How many linked lists do devs reverse a day on the job?

        - It helps Google learn about your thinking process
    - They have you solve these problems in a Google Doc in English using sentences and writing the code underneath and explaining your decisions
