### Preparing for the hunt

- Started job hunting in July/August (3 years ago?)
    - Applying, talking to recruiters, not making it past screens
    - Doesn't take rejection well
    - Focused on her 100Hours project, went 200-300 hours
    - Multiplayer math project: React, Flask, MongoDB, Socket.io, Python (backend)
        - Choose math operator you want to be quizzed on
        - It generated 10 questions
        - Generated code to your "room" you could share with friends
        - They could take the same quiz as you & compete
        - Finished her project by August/September
    - October had interviews every week
        - Halloween had interview with Tailored Brands & got the email developer position
        - He told her he just wants to hire her & cancelled other interviews
        - Started Nov 15, right before Black Friday
- She was coding every single day
    - Streaming a lot, leetcode & Codewars
    - Wasn't good about Anki but used Banki, practiced Banki on stream
        - Good feedback answering people
    - Was referred to the job by someone else from 100Devs who told her what questions to expect (HTML, CSS, JS questions)
        - "Can you access this object in an array", etc.
    - Leon said that streaming gets you used to talking all the time & makes you better at talking through processes
    - Her referral came from her streaming on Twitch & posting on Twitter
        - They had a coffee chat first to see if she had the skills
        - Didn't work out at first b/c they wanted more experience
        - Recruiter said that if he has more positions open, they'll keep her in mind
            - Reached out to her when the email developer position came up
    - Streaming can be overwhelming, chat in particular can throw you off if you're working on a project
    - Tweets were about progress on her project, she shared what she was working on, milestones, etc.
        - Stuff she learned, frustrations, things she accomplished
- Interviewed for 9 companies
    - 7 were cold applied
    - 2 were people who reached out online
    - At least 15 referrals before she got the 9 company interviews
    - Didn't head back from companies she emailed
    - Biggest leads were from posting on Twitter & cold applying
        - Local job board & LinkedIn
            - Looked for jobs posted in the last 24 hours, hybrid or in-person
        - Googled jobs in the area b/c they don't all appear on LinkedIn
- Speaking at conferences also helped a lot
    - Two companies she interviewed with this week reached out b/c they see her online presence
    - Google shows YouTube videos first, high up in the rankings/results
    - Leon: Videos de-risk you, they see you can code, conferences show you know enough to put you on stage
        - In a smaller environment, this will all show social proof that you are who you say you are, they otherwise don't know if you're AI or if you're making stuff up
        - Posting pics of yourself shows you're a real person, builds an online presence
- Wishes she had prepared more
    - When interviewing, wasn't doing 40 hours of coding in a week
    - With lots of interviews, she didn't have time to code, there was a month w/o code once
        - This threw her off for some technicals, but not others
    - Was wrapping stuff up at one job, went out of town for a week, was moving
    - If she felt that she didn't do well in a technical, she would do it over & over again & rehearse it (like with axios, she looked later how she could improve getting data)
    - Practicing Banki, recording & playing it back to see how to make her answers more natural (getting more interviews makes you get better at it)
    - If you're getting rejections, don't let it affect you, reframe it - you're even getting these interviews, be genuine & show your personality
    - Leon: She had momentum, was always taking action, kept moving

### Email Developer

- Creating HTML & CSS for marketing emails
- Was a real PITA, 106 different email clients that had to render properly on
- Each OS/email client renders things differently
    - Older Windows versions used MS Word to render
- Black Friday, she had to do like 100 emails
    - Found she worked really well under pressure
- Was supposed to be a temporary job just for the holidays
- With a month, she was fully ramped up & was doing full campaigns in 45 mins
    - Converted to full-time
    - Ended up fixing mistakes from coworkers
    - Delivered pixel-perfect results
    - Felt secure working there b/c she knew her output was appreciated
- Got to the point where she felt like she'd learned everything she could
    - Was building JS games outside of work to keep up her skills
    - She just used Node to maintain build pipelines for herself
    - Wasn't using React, etc.
- Couldn't take off time around the holidays b/c that was the busy season
- Was supposed to have half-day Fridays, but never happened b/c email wanted peope on-call
- She had to work overtime to fix issues & get campaigns done ASAP
- None of this was building the skills she wanted & she was getting burned out
    - She went ahead & quit 
    - March/April of 2024 she said she was job hunting on streams
        - Would't tweet about it b/c coworkers followed her
        - Would say if on stream when coworkers weren't watching
    - Someone reached out to her with a position
        - She joined him on weekends, part time for 10 hours a week
        - Left Tailored Brands to join him full-time

### Programmer position

- Doing 30-40 hours & getting paid hourly was hard to do
    - Would do 20-30 hours, then 10 hours/week, then 6 hours/week
    - Because she was interviewing at other places & this was contract work
    - She was up-front about this with her boss
- Was told in Nov that the company was going to have to downsize by end of Feb
    - This told her she needs to job hunt
    - Started applying (Leon's favorite) on LinkedIn in Colorado
        - Targetting in-person/hybrid b/c they're less competitive than remote
        - First day, applied to 12 jobs, tweeted about it, got traction & referrals from that
        - Leon: She's not a dirty clicker, she's dirty clicker to generate content for the REAL hunt ;)
    - She doesn't like cold DMing people
        - She's not good at responding/keeping up with people
        - Feels guilty about reaching out to network for opportunities
        - She posted about applying & her network ended up giving her leads
    - A lot of leads went nowhere
        - Big companies had auto-rejections
        - Some were good leads but didn't work out for the role
        - Some weren't hiring yet, didn't have headcount
    - In Jan, started applying for a lot more jobs, by Jan applied to 40+
    - By end of Dec had first interview & then interviews started pouring in
        - Had 5 company interviews in Jan
            - Cold applying, doing interviews, moving forward
            - Two positions were remote, 1 was hybrid, 2 were onsite
            - 1 was 5 interviews, got an offer
            - 2 were 3-round
            - 1 was 2 rounds
        - Had interviews every week from then
        - Had 7 interviews this week
- Didn't change her resume for each role (doesn't recommend)
    - Friend helped her write a cover letter that she things was strong
    - Resume showed 2.5 years of exp as developer
    - Switched to 1 column
    - Showed her project (React, Inertia, Laravel)
- Always included cover letter when there was an option to do so
    - Also when there were text areas to do it
    - Didn't email people & include cover letters, was just applying
- For 5-round had phone screen, hiring manager, panel interview (in-person w/4-5 engineering managers), behavioral with someone from a different dept for a vibe check, VP round, CIO
    - Some questions were cRAZY & she celebrated even having answers for them with a mimosa
    - She would have to ask up to 4 follow-up questions to find out what they were asking
        - Would she use class-based React components or functional components
        - Which would she use with hooks
            - Class-based can't even use hooks & THEY'RE DEPRECATED
        - Asked if she'd used "class-based CSS"
            - She asked "do you mean have I ever used classes to select HTML elements?"
        - Asked if she'd used DFS or BFS and which one she preferred and why and when she'd use one over the other
        - They didn't respond to her email about what she can use on the coding interview
            - Asked her about it during the interview (Did anyone get back to you?) & told her she can use anything she wants
        - Told her they're going to give her a timed 15-min problem, turn off their cameras & observe her
            - The paper said that she's given an 80 TB DB & has to analyze it, what does she do
                - She asked for context: the person who made the DB quit, its your first day, what do you do?
        - Whiteboarded Fizzbuz
        - Coded a light/dark mode
    - CIO was supposed to approve the offer, but that was his LAST DAY
        - Got offer of $90k which was the highest offer, she accepted
- One company she turned down b/c she didn't think they'd be a good fit for her
- Another she liked but they canceled b/c they had no hard start date 
    - They want to keep in touch for when they do have a start date
- Another kept her on hold for the final round for a month
- Two companies let her know that they went with someone else
- Even though she accepted an offer (start date is the 24th) she got DMs for other interviews
    - She's interviewing with 3 other companies right now
- She moved this part Saturday to get closer to the company to avoid traffic

### Last bits of advice

- Even if people are interviewing a lot, they're feeling the same feelings you are
    - She didn't post about sobbing her eyes out after failing interviews
    - She was in the trough of sorrow a lot, didn't feel good enough, even with offer
    - What you see on social media is refined, even if its genuine, its not the whole picture
- Even when its scare to share, share as much as you can, it leads to opportunities
    - People reach out to tell her they're waiting for an update, they get invested in your story
    - Conferences, Tweeting, sharing on Twitch, its all scary, but do it

## Chat

- Straine ‚Äî Learned the idea of "moral injury" the other day, and it's pretty bad within medicine and teaching.  Having all of the responsibility, all of the accountability, and none of the autonomy leads to an extremely stressful and unfulfilling experience.
- Lexi (Class 35) ‚Äî see, even the people who seemed to have it together cried and suffered too
- choir241 (Richard) ‚Äî Bluesky, Linkedin, they're all social media at the end of the day. The only thing that's really changing is the people who are active on them.
- Meriem ‚Äî is streaming really a good option for a beginner??
    - Niko (lurk) ‚Äî If you put in the hours and build... you won't be "a beginner" for long. So yea, it's a good accountability metric to get you building things and networking at the same time.
    - CorkyTheCactus ‚Äî It can be, several folks in the stream team started as beginners
        - You don't have to be an expert to host groups or stream, folks like to learn with others
- CorkyTheCactus ‚Äî A lot of interviewing is smell test
    - Newbies will get nervous/defensive when they don't know something
    - Experienced engineers not knowing something? That's just tuesday, they share their thought process to figure it out
- stevenMosesCodes ‚Äî builtin.com is a site for startups, and they have different locales to choose from
- danvgar (üõ∂ü™µ) ‚Äî Even for the most bombed interviews, highly recommend folks add the questions you were asked to your own banki. It is likely not the last time you will be asked them, so why not rehearse them ahead of time
- CorkyTheCactus ‚Äî Very easy to take several wins (find job, apply, get interview, move on, make final round) and treat them like a loss simply by not being the best fit and not getting an offer
- Straine ‚Äî It's nothing but work, that's all it is.  You don't have to be the smartest, or have the most experience.  Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.

## Slido

- How do I network with people on bluesky? how to approach people and ask them for coffee chats. I want to get a remote job with a better salary than my country..
    - She's not the person to ask about coffee chats - ask Maddie or Richard
    - She's the queen of burnout, does too much, doesn't have mental capacity for coffee chats
    - She networks on Bluesky by just posting things, updates about her life, pics of herself or her coffee, comments on people's posts
        - She'll do something like look up Laravel & engage on that subject, make friends with those people, get mutual follows & maybe reach out & DM
        - For her, it doesn't feel genuine if she only reaches out if she sees a company has a job opening
        - Just comment like you would to your friends, it also leads to real friendships & if you meet these people in person, you have the groundwork for a real friendship
    - Assume the talk won't get you the job, it can take 5-10 years, build connections
